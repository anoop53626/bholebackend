# Overview:


* Video platform focusing on backend development with JavaScript.
* Utilizes  module type.
* Dependencies managed with nodemon for development.
* MongoDB used for database, specifically Atlas.


## Technologies and Tools Used:
* npm Packages: dotenv, mongoose, express, cookie-parser, cors, multer, bcrypt.js, mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2, cloudinary.

* Tools: nodemon, prettier.



## Concepts and Practices:
* Error handling using try-catch or promises.
* Environmental variables management with dotenv.
* Middleware for various functionalities.
* Use of hooks and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
* File upload handled using multer, possibly integrated with cloudinary for storage.
* Understanding of HTTP protocol: headers, methods, and status codes.
* CORS handling for cross-origin resource sharing.
* HTTP methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, DELETE, PUT, POST, PATCH.
#####  HTTP status codes categorized into informational, success, redirection, client error, and server error.

## http status code
* 1xx  : informational
* 2xx  :  success
* 3xx  : redirection
* 4xx  : client error
* 5xx  : server error

* 101(continue), 
* 102(processing)
* 200(ok)
* 201(created),202(acceptance)

## Additional Points:
* Importance of API testing tools like Thunderclient and Postman.
* Writing controllers after understanding HTTP servers.
* Knowledge of MongoDB aggregation pipeline for advanced data manipulation.
* Utilization of advanced data structure pipelines.
* Writing professional-quality code and documentation.






 ## Error Handling:
* Best Practices: Emphasize the importance of robust error handling to ensure smooth operation and improved user experience.

* Specific Errors: Mention common errors like 404 (Not Found), 401 (Unauthorized), and how they should be handled appropriately.

## Middleware:
* Custom Middleware: Discuss the creation and usage of custom middleware functions to handle specific tasks such as authentication, request validation, logging, etc.

## Middleware Order: 
* Highlight the significance of the order in which middleware functions are applied, as it can impact the behavior of the application.

## Authentication and Authorization:
* JWT: Explain in detail how JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication and authorization, including the generation, verification, and utilization of tokens.

* Hooks: Elaborate on the use of hooks, particularly pre-hooks, in conjunction with authentication processes for tasks like password hashing before saving to the database.

## File Upload:
* Middleware Usage: Describe how middleware like multer is employed for handling file uploads, including configuration options and handling multipart/form-data requests.

* Integration with Cloudinary: Explain the integration with cloudinary for cloud-based storage of uploaded files and how it enhances scalability and reliability.

## HTTP Protocol:
#### Headers: 
* Provide examples and explanations of common HTTP headers like Accept, User-Agent, Authorization, etc., and their significance in request/response handling.

#### Methods and Status Codes:
* Elaborate further on each HTTP method's purpose and common use cases, along with additional HTTP status codes beyond the ones mentioned.

## Testing:
* API Testing Tools: Offer insights into the usage and benefits of tools like Thunderclient and Postman for testing APIs, including features like request building, testing environments, and automated testing capabilities.

## Professional Development:
* Code Quality: Stress the importance of writing clean, maintainable, and professional-quality code, including adherence to coding standards, proper documentation, and consistent formatting.

## Continuous Learning:
* Encourage developers to continuously update their skills and knowledge, staying abreast of new technologies, best practices, and industry trends.








# Assignment:
* Write an article on Hashnote covering topics like aggregate pipeline
* HTTP methods:  status codes and advanced data structure in aggregate pipelines.

* fork 
* github host

# Aggregate pipeline important points:
* Aggregation pipelines run with the db.collection.aggregate() method do not modify documents in a collection, unless the pipeline contains a $merge or $out stage.
* The same stage can appear multiple times in the pipeline with these stage exceptions: $out, $merge, and $geoNear.

* use the $accumulator and $function aggregation operators to define custom aggregation expressions in JavaScript.
*
